# Jeopardy-Game

During quarantine in spring and summer of 2020, I became enthralled with the TV show Jeopardy. I have always really enjoyed trivia (and been fairly good at it if I do say so myself), but I had never really watched Jeopardy until about February of 2020. It's safe to say that I was immediately hooked and wanted to find a way to be on the show. In order to try and make this (admittedly somewhat unrealistic) dream more likely, I looked into ways to train for the show, and I was disappointed to find an overwhelming lack of resources if you wanted to train as though you were going on the show. I saw the Jeopardy Archive (which is an online database of all Jeopardy games ever played complete with questions and answers), but it did not offer the ability to "play" in the way that I wanted, so I thought I could make it better if I pulled the data it held into a GUI application that had Jeopardy game logic with timers, points, etc. That is how this project came to be, and I have loved using it almost every day to become more knowledgeable and better prepared for my eventual run at the record for longest Jeopardy win streak.
